This page demonstrates the embeddable
<strong><a href="http://webperl.zero-g.net" target="_blank">&#x1F578;&#xFE0F;&#x1F42A; WebPerl</a>
Code Demo Editor</strong> (beta), which can be embedded using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements, including
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox" target="_blank">sandboxing</a>.
The documentation is contained in the source of this page, please use
the "View Source" function of your browser to view it, or have a look at

<!-- First, you have to include the following hidden IFrame, which
loads the "Perl runner". This is (currently) necessary because this
IFrame needs to re-load itself in order to re-run Perl. This IFrame
*must* have the "name='perlrunner'" attribute and must be embedded at
the same level as the Perl editor IFrame(s). The frames communicate
via the "window.postMessage()" mechanism, which is safe for
cross-origin communications and sandboxing. Currently, in order to
conserve memory, a single runner serves multiple "clients", that is,
the "editor" IFrames below.

It is also possible to link to perleditor.html directly: if it
detects that it is not running in an IFrame, it will load the runner
on its own (after a very brief delay).
-->

<iframe name="perlrunner" sandbox="allow-scripts" src="perlrunner.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>

<p>This is a simple example of running a oneliner:</p>

<!-- The following is a basic example showing a single input file and
Perl oneliner.

All files are currently always encoded as UTF-8, which is why the
"-CSD" switch is used below. This is not strictly necessary when the
input files are pure ASCII, but it is important to remember that Perl
does *not* default to UTF-8. Reading/writing binary data via the
editor and runner is currently *not* supported.

Standard input/output redirection is currently not supported. It is
also currently not supported to supply STDIN directly to the script,
the workaround is to use input files, supply the filenames on the
command line, and use Perl's magic ARGV operator "<>". Support for
redirections may be added in a future version.

The JavaScript shown below is not strictly necessary, it is also
possible to specify a "src='...'" attribute directly in the IFrame
tag, for example using the "Copy Frame URL" link shown in the editor.

Note that implementing an automatic resize of the IFrame to fit its
contents is nontrivial when sandboxing is enabled, which is why a
fixed height is used below. However, see for example
http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/ - examples of how
to use this are included in the source files here.
-->

<iframe id="perl1" sandbox="allow-scripts" class="perleditor" style="height:20em;"></iframe>
<script>
document.getElementById('perl1').src =
	"perleditor.html#" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify( {
		inputs: [ { fn:"in.txt", text:"Foo\nBar\nQuz" } ],
		cmdline: "perl -CSD -pe 's/[aeiou]/_/g' in.txt",
	} ));
// Example of how to use the Optional "IFrame Resizer":
iFrameResize({checkOrigin:false}, document.getElementById('perl1'));
</script>

<p>This example includes several files:</p>

<!-- The following example demonstrates (almost) all of the possible
options that can be passed to the editor.

The "cmdline" supports only very basic quoting constructs.

You may specify the text of a script via "script", or, alternatively,
a "script_url" from which the script is to be fetched - however, be
aware that cross-origin restrictions may limit your ability to fetch
URLs from other origins. You can specify the script's filename with
"script_fn".

Input files ("inputs") are specified as an array of objects; the
properties of the object are similar to the script: filenames are
specified with "fn", and the text of the file via "text", or
alternatively, you may specify a "url" from which the content is to
be fetched.

The output files ("outputs") are an array of filenames. After the
script finishes, the "Perl runner" will attempt to read these files
and display them to the user. It is also possible to specify output
files with the same name as an input file, for example if Perl's "-i"
option was used.

The current working directory of Perl defaults to the "home"
directory in Emscripten's virtual file system, currently
"/home/web_user", and all filenames are relative to this directory.
You may also specify absolute filenames such as "/tmp/foo.txt".
However, note that intermediate directories are currently not
automatically created, so if you specify files with nonexistent
directories like "/tmp/foo/bar.txt" or the relative "foo/bar.txt",
this will not work.

Additional options: Setting "mergeStdOutErr" to a true value causes
STDOUT and STDERR output to be output together, similar to the way
they would be on the console.

			+"while (<>) {\n\tprint $vfh $1 while s/([aeiou])/_/i;\n\tprint;\n}\nclose $vfh;",
		script_fn: "devoweler.pl",

			{ fn: "mytext.txt", text: "Foo\nBar\nQuz\n" },
